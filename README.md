If population growth is one of many population characteristics, what makes studying it so important? In this project I will examine the impact of  population growth on GDP per capita of different countries. Data from different sources will be collected, examined and analyzed to find out if there is a relationship between population growth and GDP per capita.  
 
The reason why I chose this subject for my capstone project is because I am interested to know how meat consumption per capita , population growth and GDP per capita change overtime in different countries.  
 
Is there any relationship between population growth and  GDP in different countries?
Is there any relationship between meat consumption per capita and GDP per capita in different countries?
 
Analysis and Visualization on this project will be done using Python/Jupyter notebooks, Excel and Power BI or Tableau to show the positive or negative changes in meat consumption per capita, population growth and GDP per capita . This information can be used by any decision maker.
