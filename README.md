## Summary
population growth is one of many population characteristics, what makes studying it so important? In this project I will examine the impact of  population growth on GDP per capita of different countries. Data from different sources will be collected, examined and analyzed to find out if there is a correlation between population growth and GDP per capit, also to know if there is correlation between meat consumption per capita and GDP per capita.  

 ## Motivation
The reason why I chose this subject for my capstone project is because I am interested to know how meat consumption per capita , population growth and GDP per capita change overtime in different countries. 

## Data
 To answer the questions, Dataset for Population growth and GDP per capita  of different countries from the year 2000 to 2020 was collected from (The World Bank) and dataset for Meat Consumption per capita was collected from (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation) 


## Tools Used
- Excel -- original format of Data use for some EDA 

- Python/Pandas - for cleaning, exploration and aggregation of the data

- Power BI - For creating interactive dashboard 

- Visual Studio Code - Used to write and  editing ReadMe files

- Git - Used for version control

-There is a negative correlation of -0.19 between GDP per capita and population growth in different countries.

#### Conclusion
Result of my findings shows that there is a positive correlation of 0.29 between GDP per capita and Meat consumption per capita in different countries over a period of time. As GDP per capita increases, meat consumption per capita increases.
Furthermore, there is a negative correlation of -0.19 between GDP per capita and population growth in different countries over a period of time. As GDP per capita Increases, population growth decreases.
